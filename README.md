## This room is based on the original Pokemon series. Can you obtain all the Pokemon in this room?


## Question 1

For this room I started with an nmap scan on the attack machine.

```
nmap -sC -sV {Machine-IP}
```
I can see there is an ssh & HTTP port open. We will use both of these ports for this room.
I then opened my browser and searched the ip address in the browser. 



Scrolling to the bottom shows a weird combination of username and password.
